### Danilo Jelovac – Data Analysis & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **professional portfolio**, containing real data analysis, Python automation, and machine learning projects.  
Every project is structured using clear, industry-level folder organization and fully documented through Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.
This is a work of an aspiring Python and Data Analysis lover, trying to show personal growth.

#### Goal
Showcase strong foundations in:
- Data Cleaning  
- Visualization (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Machine Learning  
- Python automation  
- End-to-End project structuring  

Each project is developed with:
- clean notebook workflows  
- reproducible training scripts  
- modular design  
- documented insights and explanations  

---

#### Completed Projects

##### **Titanic_Dataset**
A complete ML workflow from raw data to a trained and saved predictive model.  
Includes:
- 4 data stages (raw → cleaned → ML-ready → train-ready)  
- 3 notebook phases (cleaning, visualization, model evaluation)  
- Trained Logistic Regression pipeline  
- Saved model with sample predictions  

Project folder:  
```
/Titanic_Dataset/
```

---

##### **Heart_Disease_Datataset**
A complete ML workflow from raw data to a trained and saved predictive model.  
Includes:
- 3 data stages (raw → cleaned → ML-ready)  
- 1 large notebook (cleaning, visualization, model evaluation)  
- Trained RandomForest pipeline  
- Saved model with sample predictions  

Project folder:  
```
/Heart_Disease_Dataset/
```

---

##### Skills Demonstrated
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- scikit-learn (preprocessing, pipelines, model evaluation)  
- joblib model persistence  
- clean folder hierarchy for real-world use  
- understanding of ML workflow, including training/testing splits  

---

##### Setup & Running
Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each project contains a `model_source/` folder with `train_model.py` and `test_model.py` scripts.
